![Wyvern editing its own source code](images/screenshot.png)

A minimalist graphical text editor built with xlib and cairo.

This is currently in very early development. It is missing a lot of features,
all configuration values are hard-coded, and it cannot save files.

To run, you will need to edit src/options/options.c and change the font path to
something on your machine.
