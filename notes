need to revamp architecture such that the refresh functions primarily do
rendering (maybe call them something else?). have layout recalculation be done
by those functions, and also other functions that need the layout to be
recalculated. keep system where layout changes set needsRecalculate, but have it
so that any functions which need the layout to be valid (including the refresh
functions) will call a special function that basically does what the refresh
functions do now but just for layout. this will allow the layout, in certain
areas, to be recalculated multiple times for every event so that layout changes
can depend on other layout changes. have recalculating the layout set
needsRedraw.
